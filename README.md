### Definitions
 A finite field set is a a mathematical set with a finite number of elements inside it, which also meets contains five mathematical properties.
 1. Closed Property: If a and b are in the set, a + b and a * b must also be in the set
 2. Additive Identity: 0 exists and has the property a + 0 = a/
 3. Multiplicative Identity: 1 exists and has the property a * 1 = a.
 4.
