### Definitions*
 A finite field set is a a mathematical set with a finite number of elements inside it, which also meets contains five mathematical properties.
 1. Closed Property: If a and b are in the set, a + b and a * b must also be in the set
 2. Additive Identity: 0 exists and has the property a + 0 = a/
 3. Multiplicative Identity: 1 exists and has the property a * 1 = a.
 4. Additive Inverse: If a is in the set, -a is in the set, which is defined as the value that makes a + (-a) = 0.
 5. Multiplicative Inverse Identitfy: 4. If a is in the set and is not 0, a^-1^ is in the set, which is defined as the value that makes a * a^1-1^ = 1.

 It is important to note, that it is logical to alter the mathematical functions in order to fit the criteria (e.g. using modulo arithmetic to meet the criteria is permissible, among other techniques)
